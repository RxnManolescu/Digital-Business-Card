            <p className="details-description">I am a self-taught frontend developer and I fall in love with it more and more everyday! One of the coolest things about frontend work is how you can literally see your creations come to life right in front of you. It's like instant gratification, you know? And that feeling, it just makes me want to dive even deeper, experiment more, and push the boundaries of what I can create.<span> It's addictive, but in the best way possible</span>!</p>
